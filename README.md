Compare ArrayList and LinkedList performance

It is necessary to write code that would call the main methods of collections a certain number of times (1000 or 2000, or any other). At the same time, the time must be recorded.

It is minimally necessary to test the methods:add, delete, get

After that, output a table with the results (method, how many times it was executed, execution time)
